## How to Use
Assuming you have the correct installments, you will open a terminal of your choice and move the directory to the start of the repo. Once there, you can type "npm start" to run the client and server concurrently. A website will open, and you will have the options to add users, investors, or admins. Other functions will be added to the front end, but you can test all the available routes listed under "server/routes" with testing software like insomnia.
